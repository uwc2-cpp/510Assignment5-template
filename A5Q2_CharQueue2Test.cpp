TEST(enqueueDequeue, CharQueue2)

//and so on
}

//The assignment just says "create unit tests".  Please consider carefully what set of unit tests
//is needed to exercise your object's interface, including both normal, and boundary/edge cases.
//
//As the assignment says, you should be able to use the same set of test cases for CharQueue2 as for CharQueue1
//(changing the names and changing the class that is tested, of course!)
